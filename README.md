## Hell of Mirrors

Two-player asymmetric co-op game, trying to survive waves of vampires and zombies in an arena.

- The player on the edge of the arena toggles, pans, and repairs projectors to shed light on the arena. Bat swarms damage the projectors, and can be spooked by the player.
- The player in the arena holds a mirror, and should position themselves and pan the mirror to catch projector light and channel it into beams to burn the enemies. The beam can also be used to channel energy into the core, replenishing its charge.

Vampires attack the core to deplete its charge (energy vampires, duh), while zombies hone in on the mirror player.

### Controls

- Mirror player:
  * Gamepad 1: D-pad/Left stick for movement, bumpers to pan the mirror.
